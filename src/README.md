# Nuo Lang

## What is Nuo?

Nuo is a new programming language inspired by Go, TypeScript, and Rust.

Nuo's priorities, in order:

### Simplicity

Simplicity makes it easier to learn Nuo, and to read and write it. It should be easy to understand large codebases written in Nuo, and it should be obvious how to write a solution the "right way". Core concepts should be kept simple.

### Practicality

Nuo should provide a baseline of well-defined low-level abstractions based primarily on the programmer's intent, kept as close to how the machine works "under the hood" as possible.

### Performance

It should be easy to write and optimize code for screaming-fast performance in Nuo. This includes predictable memory usage, zero GC pauses, and easy to use multi-threading.

Nuo is currently **conceptual** and there is no available implementation.
